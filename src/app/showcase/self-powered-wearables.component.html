			<p>Breathing generates distance movement, which can be collected as energy. These energy can be utilized to measure the frequency of breathing, and even heart-rate and pulse oximeter. There's a wide range of applications such as wearable devices for babies, pregnants and fitness people. </p>
			<p>However, one of the most challenging thing about monitoring breathing with breathing power is that <strong>the power is neither stable nor continuous</strong>. Using conventional microprocessors in such systems will lead to an unfortunate dilemma: the frequent power outage will destroy all intermediate data in the processor, while storing all those data into Flash memory is both energy and time consuming. </p> 
			<p>Fortunately, nonvolatile processor makes it possible to survive a power failure at negligible time and energy cost. This demo video shows a self-powered breath monitoring system consisting of a breath energy harvester (from Tahzib Safwat @ Penn State University), a nonvolatile processor and a LCD screen. The screen shows pulsed data including averaged breathing frequency and last time breath frequency. The higher 2 bits of LCD screen stand for average breathing frequency calculated through past 3 times breathing intervals. The lower 2 bits stand for the last time breathing frequency. An "L" indicates your breathing is too slow (&#60;12 times/min), and an "H" indicates too high breathing frequency (&#62;48 times/min).</p>
